# mp3shantyðŸ’¿

## Description

Mp3shanty is a companion application that allows downloading audio files to mobile and desktop devices. For a complete music player experience, a third-party media player is required.

## Setup

### Mobile (iOS)

1. Download a local audio player. I recommend the [VLC Media Player](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/vlc-media-player/id650377962) or [Nota](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nota-player-for-files/id1444318808).
2. (Optional) If using VLC, change the default downloads directory for your browser. If you use Safari, open the Settings app and navigate to Safari > Downloads. Click `On My iPhone` and select the `VLC` folder. The settings page should look like the image below. Please, keep in mind that now all downloads will be written to `VLC`, not just the MP3s from this application. Not completing this step will require you to manually move all files to `VLC`, however.

3. (Optional) Create a Home Screen shortcut for the web application.

### Desktop

Configuring on desktop should be relatively simple. All downloaded files will be written to the default downloads directory for your browser. Take note of this when using a third-party player that reads these files.
